  <ul style='font-size:20px'> 
    <li> 
          I've challenged myself to create a Machine Learning model aimed on identifying breast cancer cells fed with only two data points - one bening cell and one malign cell.
    </li>
    <li> 
          The instance selection was carried out with the use of K-Means, choosing the closest cells from the engendered clusters.
    </li>
    <li> 
          At the end of the project, a Linear Support Vector Machine reached the best results. The metric used was an f-score with beta=0.37, since the malign group made up 37% of the training set.
